= Migration logs

You can check the conversion host logs, playbook logs (if you are running premigration or postmigration playbooks), and the CloudForms log to identify the cause of a migration error.

When disk migration starts, two logs are created in the conversion host:

* `virt-v2v`: Debug output from `virt-v2v` itself. This log tracks the core of the virtual machine migration process, including `libguestfs` traces and disk migration details.
* `virt-v2v-wrapper`: Log of the daemonizing wrapper for `virt-v2v`. This log traces the orchestration of the virtual machine conversion on the conversion host, including disk migration percentages and `virt-v2v` error reporting.

For more information about the functions of `virt-v2v` and `virt-v2v-wrapper`, see the migration workflows:

* xref:Vmware_to_rhv_migration_workflow[]
* xref:Vmware_to_osp_migration_workflow[]

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you need to open a link:https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/#/case/new[Red Hat Support call], you will be required to submit both the migration (`virt-v2v`) log and `virt-v2v-wrapper` log for analysis.
