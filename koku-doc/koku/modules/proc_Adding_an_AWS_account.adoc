Using the information from the previous steps, you can now add your AWS account as a source. After adding an AWS source, the cost and usage data from your AWS account will be processed and made viewable within the Cost Management application.

. In Cost Management, click *Add source* to open the dialog.
. In the dialog, select *Amazon Web Services (AWS)* as the source type.
. Enter a name for the source and click *Next*.
. Paste your S3 bucket name and click *Next*.
. Paste the role ARN and click *Add source*.

Cost Management will begin collecting cost and usage data from your AWS account. This can take a few days to populate to show on your dashboard.
