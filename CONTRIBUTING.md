Contributing to Koku-doc
==========================

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project!

The following are a set of guidelines for contributing to Koku. These are
guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgement. Feel free to suggest changes to
this document in a pull-request.

This document uses [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt/) keywords to indicate requirement levels.

Reporting Bugs & Requesting Features
------------------------------------

We use Github Issues to track bug reports and feature requests.

When submitting a bug report, please be as detailed as possible. Include as
much of these items as you have:

  #. section and line of incorrect data

  #. Mistatement of the documentation

When submitting a feature request, please submit them in the form of a user
story with acceptance criteria:

  As a [user],

  I want [a thing],
  
  So that [some goal].

  When complete, I will be able to:

  #. [do this]

  #. [do that]
  
  #. [do another]

Contributing Documentation (Pull Requests)
------------------------------------------

All code contributions MUST come in the form of a pull-request. Pull-requests
will be reviewed for a variety of criteria. This section attempts to capture as
much of that criteria as possible.


Documentation testing considerations
------------------------------------

We believe that documentation is a critical component to every successful
project. For this reason, all pull-requests MUST build cleanly when run.
