// Module included in the following assemblies:
//
// <List assemblies here, each on a new line>

// Base the file name and the ID on the module title. For example:
// * file name: proc_creating_an_OCP_cost_model.adoc
// * ID: [id="proc_creating_an_OCP_cost_model"]
// * Title: = Creating an OCP cost model

// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module. Avoid changing it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not broken.
[id="proc_creating_an_OCP_cost_model"]
// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID includes {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is reused multiple times in a guide.
= Creating an OpenShift Container Platform cost model
// Start the title of a procedure module with a verb, such as Creating or Create. See also _Wording of headings_ in _The IBM Style Guide_.

For OpenShift Container Platform sources, creating a cost model includes assigning prices for usage and requests, as well as applying a markup or discount to determine the total costs of your OpenShift infrastructure.

// .Prerequisites

.Procedure


. From the *Cost model details* menu, click *Create cost model* to open the cost model wizard.
. Enter a name and description for the cost model, and select *Amazon Web Services (AWS)* for the source type to apply the cost model to. Click *Next*.
. Enter a percentage value to apply a markup to the costs, and click *Next*. 
* To apply a discount instead of a markup, enter a minus sign with the value (for example, _-15_). 
* If you do not want to apply a markup or discount, enter _0_.

[NOTE]
====
You can use a markup to account for your overhead costs, such as the cost of administering the cluster, or support costs, for example. A markup is an estimation to cover your costs not shown by metrics or usage.
====

. Select one or multiple sources to assign the cost model to and click *Next*. Selecting a source with a cost model already assigned will override its previous cost model. 
. Review the cost model details, and click *Finish* to create it.

Review your tags and tagging strategy to ensure that costs are being distributed to the correct resources, cost centers, or teams. See the guide _Using tagging to manage cost data_ for more information.
