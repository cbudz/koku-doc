// Module included in the following assemblies:
//
// assembly_organizing_cost_data_using_tags.adoc

// Base the file name and the ID on the module title. For example:
// * file name: enabling_tag_grouping_OCP.adoc
// * ID: [id="enabling_tag_grouping_OCP"]
// * Title: = Enabling OpenShift tag grouping

// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module. Avoid changing it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not broken.
[id="enabling_tag_grouping_OCP"]
// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID includes {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is reused multiple times in a guide.

= Enabling OpenShift tag grouping

By default, cost management groups OpenShift cost data by cluster, node, and project on the *OpenShift details* page. Grouping data by tag key can be useful to further customize your view.

To group your cost data by tag key, you must enable the tag keys in the cloud.redhat.com application settings. 

.Prerequisites

* Question: do you need to have a certain role/RBAC privileges to control this?
// * You must be an Account Administrator or a member of a group with the _RBAC Administrator_ role to create a role.
// In AWS, an Account Admin? where is the group RBAC Admin - AWS or RH Insights?

.Procedure

To enable OpenShift tag keys for grouping:

. Click image:configuration-gear.png[] (*Settings*) to navigate to *Applications*.
. Click the *OpenShift Tag Management*.
. Select the keys you want to report on in the cost management application from the *Available Tag Keys* list and use the arrows to move the tags to the *Enabled Tag Keys* list. 
. Click *Submit* to save your changes.

.Verification steps

The enabled tag keys will now be available to group costs by from the *OpenShift details* area of cost management, in the *Group cost by* list. For example:
