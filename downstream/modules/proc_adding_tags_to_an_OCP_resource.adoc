// Module included in the following assemblies:
//
// assembly_organizing_cost_data_using_tags.adoc

// Base the file name and the ID on the module title. For example:
// * file name: proc_adding_labels_to_an_OCP_namespace.adoc
// * ID: [id="proc_adding_labels_to_an_OCP_namespace"]
// * Title: = Adding labels to an OpenShift namespace

// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module. Avoid changing it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not broken.
[id="proc_adding_labels_to_an_OCP_namespace"]
// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID includes {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is reused multiple times in a guide.
= Adding labels to an OpenShift namespace
// Start the title of a procedure module with a verb, such as Creating or Create. See also _Wording of headings_ in _The IBM Style Guide_.

// This paragraph is the procedure module introduction: a short description of the procedure.

The AWS tag equivalent in OpenShift is a label, which also consists of a key:value pair. Cost Management collects OpenShift tag data from pods and persistent volumes (or persistent volume claims) using Prometheus metrics and Operator Metering.

One method of adding tags to OpenShift resources is to specify labels to add in a template. 

//TODO [Need docs link how to do this]
// Ask an OpenShift expert to review this -- that this is the best way for OCP 4.3

Or to add labels manually:

.Procedure

To add a label to a namespace in OpenShift:

. In the OpenShift web console, navigate to Administration > Namespaces.
. Click your Namespace to open the Namespace overview.
. From the Namespace Overview page, click Actions > Edit labels to open the dialog box showing labels assigned to your project.
. Enter your labels, for example: openshift.io/cluster-monitoring=true
. Click Save.
. Run the Usage Collector script again to refresh the tags:
+
----
/path/to/ocp_usage.sh â€“collect
----

Wait an hour for the data to refresh and be visible in Cost Management. 


.Verification steps

To view your tags, navigate to a resource in the OpenShift web console. Any assigned labels are listed under the Labels heading, for example: openshift.io/cluster-monitoring=true.
