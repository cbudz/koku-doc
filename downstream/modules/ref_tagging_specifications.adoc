// Module included in the following assemblies:
//
// assembly_managing_cost_data_tagging.adoc

// Base the file name and the ID on the module title. For example:
// * file name: ref_tagging_specifications.adoc
// * ID: [id="ref_tagging_specifications"]
// * Title: = Tag specifications by source type

// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module. Avoid changing it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not broken.
[id="ref_tagging_specifications"]
// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID includes {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is reused multiple times in a guide.

= Tag specifications by source type

Tagging standards differ between source types. To use the same tags/labels across sources, you must use the most common of all the restrictions across the different providers.

The following table summarizes tagging and labelling criteria across AWS, Azure and OpenShift Container Platform 4: 

.Tagging specifications by source
[options="header"]
|====
|Criteria|AWS|Azure|Red Hat OpenShift
|Name|Tags|Tags|Labels
|Format|Key & value|Name & value|Key & value
Keys: [prefix/]name
Prefix: must be a DNS subdomain
|Allows empty value|Yes|Yes|Yes
|Unique label per key|Yes|Yes|Yes
|Case sensitive|Yes|No|Yes
|Limit per resource|50|50 (15 for storage)|N/A
|Length of key|128|512 (128 for storage)|253(prefix) / 63(name)

|Length of value|256|256|63
|Allowed characters
|Letters, numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the following characters: + - = . _ : / @
|Tag names cannot contain these characters: <, >, %, &, \, ?, /

|Restrictions
|The prefix “aws:” is reserved.
Tags applied to EC2 can use any character.
Not all resource types support tags.
|Not all resource types support tags. Generalized VMs do not support tags. Tags applied to the resource group are not inherited by the resources.
|Prefixes kubernetes.io/ and k8s.io/ are reserved.
Not all resource types support tags.

|Notes
|You need to select the tag keys that will be included in cost and usage files and billing reports.
|You can use a JSON string to go over the limit of keys.
|If the prefix is omitted, the label Key is presumed to be private to the user.
