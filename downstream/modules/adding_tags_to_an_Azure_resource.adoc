 EDIT THIS FOR AZURE

Amazon creates certain tags automatically, like the EC2 instance resource identifier (a number such as i-123456789).

You can also add your own tags at the individual resource level. These tags must be activated for Cost and Usage reporting to export them to the cost management application.

Configure AWS tags for cost management using the following steps:

.Procedure

. Create and apply tags to your AWS resources. 
+
See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/custom-tags.html[_User-Defined Cost Allocation Tags_] in the AWS documentation for instructions.
+
. Activate the tags you want to be collected by the cost management application via the Cost and Usage Report. In the AWS Billing console, select the tags you want to activate from the Cost Allocation Tags area. 
+
See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/activate-built-in-tags.html[_Activating the AWS-Generated Cost Allocation Tags_] in the AWS documentation for instructions.
