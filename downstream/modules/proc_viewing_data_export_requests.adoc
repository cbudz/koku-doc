// Module included in the following assemblies:
//
// <List assemblies here, each on a new line>

// Base the file name and the ID on the module title. For example:
// * file name: proc_viewing_data_export_requests.adoc
// * ID: [id="proc_viewing_data_export_requests"]
// * Title: = Viewing previous data export requests

// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module. Avoid changing it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not broken.
[id="proc_viewing_data_export_requests"]
// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID includes {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is reused multiple times in a guide.
= Viewing previous data export requests

You can use the API to list previous data export requests. This can be useful as 

.Procedure

. To retrieve a list of data export requests that were created by the authenticated user, run an HTTP GET request with the URL `/api/cost-management/v1/dataexportrequests/`. For example:
+
----
HTTP GET localhost:8000/api/cost-management/v1/dataexportrequests/
----
+
//add example output
. To retrieve a requested data export request by UUID (assuming it is reachable by the authenticated user), run an HTTP GET request with the URL `/api/cost-management/v1/dataexportrequests/{uuid}/`. For example:
+
----
HTTP GET localhost:8000/api/cost-management/v1/dataexportrequests/{uuid}/
----
//add example output

////
//.Verification steps
//(Optional) Provide the user with verification method(s) for the procedure, such as expected output or commands that can be used to check for success or failure.

* Currently, modules cannot include xrefs, so you cannot include links to other content in your collection. If you need to link to another assembly, add the xref to the assembly that includes this module.
* For more details on writing procedure modules, see the link:https://github.com/redhat-documentation/modular-docs#modular-documentation-reference-guide[Modular Documentation Reference Guide].
