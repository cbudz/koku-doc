After adding your AWS and OpenShift Container Platform sources, in addition to showing cost data by source, cost management will automatically show AWS cost and usage related to running your OpenShift Container Platform clusters on AWS. 

The cost management application tracks these costs using tags (called labels in OpenShift), which you can refine to filter and attribute to resources. Tags in cost management allow you to organize your resources by cost and to allocate the costs to different parts of your cloud infrastructure.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Tags and labels can only be configured directly on a source. You cannot edit tags and labels in the cost management application.

////


In order to control which tags cost management imports, activate or enable the tags you want to view by source:

* AWS tags must be activated, and are then selected and exported to cost management in the Cost and Usage report. See https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.3/html-single/getting_started_with_cost_management/index#activating_aws_tags[Activating AWS tags for cost management] in the _Getting started with cost management_ guide for instructions. 
* Azure tags are exported to cost management in the Cost Export report.
* OpenShift Container Platform labels are exported by Metering and included in the metrics reports that cost management uses as input. Enable tag key grouping in the cloud.redhat.com application settings to specify which tags to group your cost data by.
