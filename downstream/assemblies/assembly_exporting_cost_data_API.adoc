ifdef::context[:parent-context: {context}]

// Base the file name and the ID on the assembly title. For example:
// * file name: assembly_exporting_cost_data_API.adoc
// * ID: [id="assembly_exporting_cost_data_API"]
// * Title: = Exporting cost data using the API

// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module. Avoid changing it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not broken.
[id="assembly_exporting_cost_data_API"]
// If the assembly is reused in other assemblies in a guide, include {context} in the ID: [id="a-collection-of-modules_{context}"].
= Exporting cost data using the API
:context: assembly-keyword
// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID includes {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is reused multiple times in a guide.

You can use the cost management data export request API to obtain cost data for your sources, such as information about usage, tags, cost model assignments, and more. 

Using the API, you can export cost data easily to your external business integration tools to generate custom reports, and to view and compare your data in additional ways to those provided by the cost management application. 

The API also allows you to view historical cost data beyond what is available to view in the cost management user interface (at the time of writing, the cost management user interface shows the previous 2-3 months of data).
//Is this the name we want to refer to the API by? The data export request API?

// Does this also allow the user to obtain historical cost data that is not shown in the Koku graphs? 

This guide provides instructions for using the API to export your cost data.
