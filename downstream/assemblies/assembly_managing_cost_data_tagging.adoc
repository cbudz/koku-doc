// Base the file name and the ID on the assembly title. For example:
// * file name: assembly_managing_cost_data_tagging.adoc
// * ID: [id="assembly_managing_cost_data_tagging"]
// * Title: = Managing cost data using tagging

// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module. Avoid changing it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not broken.
[id="assembly_managing_cost_data_tagging"]
// If the assembly is reused in other assemblies in a guide, include {context} in the ID: [id="a-collection-of-modules_{context}"].
= Managing cost data using tagging
:context: tagging
// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID includes {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is reused multiple times in a guide.

This guide explains in depth how tagging works in cost management, and how you can use tagging to best organize your resources to manage your costs.
