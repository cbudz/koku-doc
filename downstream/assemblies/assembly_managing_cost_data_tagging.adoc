ifdef::context[:parent-context: {context}]

// Base the file name and the ID on the assembly title. For example:
// * file name: assembly_managing_cost_data_tagging.adoc
// * ID: [id="assembly_managing_cost_data_tagging"]
// * Title: = Managing cost data using tagging

// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module. Avoid changing it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not broken.
[id="assembly_managing_cost_data_tagging"]
// If the assembly is reused in other assemblies in a guide, include {context} in the ID: [id="a-collection-of-modules_{context}"].
= Managing cost data using tagging
:context: assembly-keyword
// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID includes {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is reused multiple times in a guide.

This guide explains in depth how tagging works in cost management, and how you can use tagging to best organize your resources to manage your costs.

// For instructions on adding tags to AWS and OpenShift Container Platform resources, see [LINK TO GETTING STARTED GUIDE]

// The following include statements pull in the module files that comprise the assembly. Include any combination of concept, procedure, or reference modules required to cover the user story. You can also include other assemblies.
