ifdef::context[:parent-context: {context}]

// Base the file name and the ID on the assembly title. For example:
// * file name: assembly_cost_limiting_access_rbac.adoc
// * ID: [id="assembly_cost_limiting_access_rbac"]
// * Title: = Limiting access to cost management resources

// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module. Avoid changing it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not broken.
[id="assembly_cost_limiting_access_rbac"]
// If the assembly is reused in other assemblies in a guide, include {context} in the ID: [id="a-collection-of-modules_{context}"].
= Limiting access to cost management resources
//:context: assembly-keyword
// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID includes {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is reused multiple times in a guide.

You may not want users to have access to all cost data, but instead only data specific to their projects or organization. Using role-based access control, you can limit the visibility of resources involved in cost management reports.

[CHECK BELOW PARAGRAPHS ARE STILL TRUE] 
Role-based access control works by organizing users into groups, which can be associated with one or more policies. A policy associates a group with a set of roles. A role defines a permission and a set of resource definitions.

By default, a user who is not an account administrator will not have access to data, but instead must be granted access to resources. Account administrators can view all data without any further role-based access control configuration.

/////
Edit and include a brief overview of steps.
- basic flow:

1. Create a role
2. Create a policy (assign role to policy)
3. Create a group (assign ? to group)

?? (Users are created outside cost, Red Hat login is a user?)
4. Assign a user to role (or group?)
/////

.Prerequisites

// Is this still correct? Org admin?
* At least one Red Hat account user with Organization Administrator entitlements. 

You will use this Red Hat login to look up users, add them to groups, and to assign policies controlling visibility to resources.
