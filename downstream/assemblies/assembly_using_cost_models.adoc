// This assembly is included in the following assemblies:

ifdef::context[:parent-context: {context}]

// Base the file name and the ID on the assembly title. For example:
// * file name: assembly_using_cost_models.adoc
// * ID: [id="using_cost_models"]
// * Title: = Using cost models

// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module. Avoid changing it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not broken.
[id="using_cost_models"]
// If the assembly is reused in other assemblies in a guide, include {context} in the ID: [id="a-collection-of-modules_{context}"].
= Using cost models
:context: cost_models
// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID includes {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is reused multiple times in a guide.

This document describes how to use cost models in cost management to apply a price to usage in
your cloud environment, then distribute the costs to resources.
